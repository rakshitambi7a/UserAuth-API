# User Management API 

## Project Overview

A comprehensive Flask-based REST API built to demonstrate modern backend development practices, security implementations, and clean architecture patterns.

## Key Technical Achievements

### 🏗️ Clean Architecture Implementation
- **Repository Pattern**: Separated data access logic from business logic
- **Service Layer**: Implemented domain-driven design with clear service boundaries
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilized dependency-injector for IoC and better testability
- **Modular Structure**: Organized codebase into logical modules for maintainability

### 🔐 Security-First Approach
- **JWT Authentication**: Implemented stateless authentication with secure token management
- **Password Security**: Argon2 hashing with salt for password storage
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries throughout the application
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented to prevent brute-force attacks and abuse
- **Security Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for security events

### 🧪 Test-Driven Development
- **44 Comprehensive Tests**: Complete test suite covering unit and integration scenarios
- **Security Testing**: Dedicated tests for authentication, authorization, and input validation
- **Isolated Test Environment**: Separate test database and configuration
- **High Coverage**: Tests cover all critical business logic and edge cases

### 🚀 Production-Ready Features
- **Environment Configuration**: Flexible configuration management for different environments
- **Database Migration**: Automated scripts for schema updates and data migration
- **Cross-Platform Setup**: Automated setup scripts for Unix/Linux/macOS and Windows
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **API Documentation**: Well-documented endpoints with clear request/response formats

## Technical Stack

**Backend Framework**: Flask 2.3.2  
**Authentication**: JWT (PyJWT 2.8.0)  
**Database**: SQLite with migration support  
**Security**: Werkzeug password hashing, Flask-Limiter for rate limiting  
**Architecture**: Dependency Injection (dependency-injector 4.41.0)  
**Testing**: pytest with comprehensive test coverage  
**Development**: Virtual environment with automated setup

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Authentication |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| POST | `/users` | Create new user | No |
| GET | `/users` | List all users (secure) | Yes |
| GET | `/users/{id}` | Get user by ID | Yes |
| PUT | `/users/{id}` | Update user | Yes |
| DELETE | `/users/{id}` | Delete user | Yes |
| POST | `/auth/login` | User authentication | No |
